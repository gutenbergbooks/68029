<p class="dropcap">We appear to have been surrounded in these weeks by a
polemic atmosphere. Tremendous controversies have
proved and disproved the validity of Christianity, the inability of
the Faculty and Corporation to make great men from Yale undergraduates,
and whether we should be made to go to Chapel on
Sundays and to recitations on other days. Editorials, communications,
and private discussions continue to feed the maw of this
wholesale argumentative machinery, and to the casual observer,
a spirit of radicalism hovers above the campus, clouding or illuminating
it as the individual chooses to suppose.</p>

<p>There is no place here to discuss the beneficial effect of controversy
upon thought. Nor is there any need for pointing out
the possibility of reform arising from the conviction which thought
brings. It is the controversy itself which is interesting, especially
in an institution where experience and tradition form the basis
of the laws and customs. Controversy at Yale must mean an
offensive begun by young minds upon what time has taught their
controlling elders. And consequently, as is being seen, it takes
a ton of controversy to germinate a pound of “reform”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>But young minds are impulsively active. They are impatient,
and the distant hope of a change in a present state of affairs holds
in itself a vast attraction. The philosophy of “all things must
change”, applied to conditions as well as to matter, extends a
sweet and optimistic prospect to youth. And it is to this natural
tendency, as well as to any deep-rooted sincerity concerning evils,
that much of our controversy may be attributed. And when a
beginning has been made, a flaming question raised, there are the
additional attractions of being given an opportunity to turn clever
phrases, to appear in the public eye, to champion or rend in a
spirit of battle. The argumentative machinery clanks frantically,
and the sound and rhythm of it beats a false sincerity into the
minds of the controversialists, a kind of belief founded more upon
emotional than mental activity; more upon desire than knowledge.</p>

<p>A controversy may be said to be worth while to us only when
it involves more thought than impulse. A questionaire has recently
been sent broadcast through the University which is quite
definite in its spirit of controversy, but which falls for no definiteness
of thought. Rather, it requires the impulsive reply, the
mere “yes” or “no” form. Do we (yes or no) think Sunday
Chapel should be abolished? Are we (yes or no) in favor of
unlimited cuts from recitations for those whose stand is above
70 per cent.? Although there is certainly no chance to turn
phrases here, the philosophy of change readily asserts itself. It
is so easy and delightful to change things with a slight swift
affirmation or negation. Those who write “yes” to the suggestion
of unlimited cuts may be the identical persons who have been
complaining that certain professors require all cuts, even within
the present limited range, to be made up. Nor do those hasty
souls pause to consider that continuous attendance would be inevitably
required under the new system through a more severe
grading and a greater emphasis upon examinations. But it is so
easy and delightful to write “yes”, whereas to reply in the negative
would indicate a desire for the boring continuation of existing
conditions!</p>

<p>Then, says the non-University man, what is the advantage of
a system of education which stimulates emotional rather than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
rational opinion? The answer is simply we learn through disappointments,
and through a later realization of our childlike
wistfulness for new things. This latter begins often as early as
our Senior year, in which we realize other things as well, including
our transience as undergraduates and our lack of time for conducting
many of the new states of affairs which we advocate so
heartily, such as complete student government. There is too much
extra-curriculum activity already in our lives here to allow us to
be administrators as well. Also, in Senior year, we tend to acquire
more or less veneration for the force of experience and for the
opinions of older minds than our own. The greatest lesson of
life is dawning upon us,—that the truest form of living is one
which is built upon simplicity, fundamentals, and a direction of
our actions by old example.</p>

<p>University life, operating upon our intelligent spirit, is the
emerging from the sensationalism of thought and action craved
by youth, into the more simple contemplative nature of maturity.
In our Freshman and Sophomore years we seek diversion almost
wholly in gaudy forms. Then,—too soon, it seems—we find that
we were wrong, that it is the life of the Quadrangle, the relationship
of friends, the contact with the internal rather than with the
external shows, which are the vital and permanent attractions.
The fire-brand element is prone to vanish.</p>

<p>Whether all this may be considered too conservative in the
present day and place; whether, in itself, it is a turning of phrases,
or invites controversy by <i>attacking</i> controversy, is extraneous.
Whether it may be thought to neglect too much the good influence
of controversy upon right thinking, is another and fairer question.
One thing it seeks to inculcate: a realization of the component
parts of undergraduate controversy, a useful knowledge of the
natural emotional forces involved which veil clarity; so that truth
may be found more fully than in the replies to questionaires and
in the disputes revolving about destructive editorials.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">If Helen Trumbull had lived in the 19th, instead of in the 20th
century, there would have been no turmoil in her life and little
romance. But being a child of the Victorian era, rigorously instructed
in the puritanism of old Connecticut, and taught to accept
without question the old moral axioms of her forefathers, she
was confronted, at the very outset of her career, with the conflict
between her moral heritage, and the desire to cultivate her active
mind. Of course, at the age of ten or twelve, no such conflict
existed. What the Bible said about lying, and loving God and
your neighbor seemed adequate to cover any of life’s emergencies.
Marriage was taken for granted: it was a straight-forward compact
with God. There was nothing to be concealed in the marriage
relationship. Father and mother were just two people.</p>

<p>These things are all familiar to the modern reader. He has
heard about them. Indeed, most readers have themselves sprung
from some such atmosphere, and know, to their sorrow, how the
19th century prepared one for life. But Helen, like most of us,
thought herself the exception rather than the rule. When she
came home, after commencement exercises in her twelfth year,
bearing the “best scholarship” cup, and a prize for a theme about
the life of Christ, she experienced, for the first time, that feeling
of confidence in her own mental prowess, which was to accompany
her through life. Henceforth, the pleasure of exercising her
mind was among the greatest of all pleasures. Henceforth, she
could not be content with accepting everything on faith. And,
perhaps, at this point we may place the beginning of a conflict in
her nature which she never quite succeeded in solving.</p>

<p>Of course the difficulty grew slowly and imperceptibly. She
was confirmed in the Episcopal Church. She took her vows
with the utmost solemnity, her whole nature responding passionately
to the mystery of her religion. After confirmation there
was a deep sense of responsibility toward God, as well as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
appeal, derived from the beauty of the Christian conception, which
aroused a strain of poetry in her. And these things were only
intensified as she grew to understand the prerogatives and the
subtleties of womanhood. At school she was respected for her
brilliance and conscientiousness, and loved for her dark eyes and
hair, her slim figure, and the frank, open-hearted way she had
of talking to people. She was not a “leader”, because her intense
religious faith made her a trifle “different”. Yet the girls felt
that they could always go to her when assistance of any kind was
needed. And the boys who fell in love with her eyes were always
treated in the kindest, most sympathetic way. They did not know
how much it thrilled her to have a crowd of them to “manage”,
nor how many hours she had spent scheming for secret and complicated
flirtations.</p>

<p>However, “the truth will out”, and it soon became whispered
that Helen was a “flirt”—although “just in fun”. Indeed, the
game held a dual fascination for her, because it not only satisfied
her love of emotional excitement and mystery, but also supplied
a field of activity into which her mind could overflow. Neither
her teachers nor her parents recognized this. They smiled, in
a reminiscent way, and rejected the thought that Helen was
learning to play with fire.</p>

<p>When she was sixteen, she played once too often, with a boy
named Harry McMichael, who was a freshman football hero at
Harvard. His vigorous personality, and the almost savage way
he took her hand, after she had tempted him for several days
“in fun”, quite swept her away, so that her puritanism seemed
all afloat in a flood of emotions. She had never thought of this
contingency. Heretofore, she had been mistress, not only of her
lovers, but of herself also. Yet this time the dams seemed to
break. And she found herself leading Harry on, quite delicately—unsatisfied
until he had kissed her. She even made him do it
more than once, although, as it appeared to him, reluctantly.</p>

<p>After this episode her conscience roused itself from a New
England slumber, and asserted the old principles, even to the
verge of extreme asceticism. But there was no longer the old
mystery lurking in life; and, coincidently, there was no longer the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
old fascination in the communion service. She wrote Harry a
letter saying that they had done wrong; they must never do it
again. But she could not really believe this—what was there
wrong about it, anyway? At the time, it was beautiful. And
there ought to be nothing left for regret save perhaps the memory
of that beauty. It seemed to her extremely narrow to eliminate
this kind of relationship from life entirely—to sit back and wait
for a stupid old husband. She read a good deal of Shelley, and
managed, against all odds, to skim through a book by Havelock
Ellis. Reason, she said, ought to dominate life—reason and
beauty. So she smoked a cigarette and experienced a wild,
imaginative thrill—a thrill which only ended in the old pangs of
conscience which seemed to curse her in every new venture.</p>

<p>A more trying experience arrived a year later, when she met
John Emerson, from Williams, flirted with him in her usual
manner, and was for a second time overcome by her emotions.
In this case, however, she had been even more the aggressor than
in the former, and poor John, who had himself a puritan ancestry
and a dim belief in the ways of God, could do nothing but respond
to her clever insinuations. Four or five times they met, during
the summer. Each time, it seemed to Helen that a new world had
been opened up before her. Each time, the old world receded a
step, though tearing with it part of her heart. Yet John announced
one night, passionately, that he loved her and wanted to marry
her. She was overwhelmed. She had not thought of love—like
that. She did not love John. She wept.</p>

<p>Here at last common sense came to perform a function which
religion seemed powerless to perform. John held her tightly and
stroked her dark hair, but she writhed inwardly. A kind of
agony petrified her. This was her work—her damnable thoughtlessness.
She had made him love.</p>

<p>Of course it all ended in a tragedy, and she had to send John
away, definitely. The old religion was sought as a refuge from
strife. It afforded immeasurable comfort. God seemed clothed
in His truest light—that of the forgiver—the comforter. Her
heart could not worship Him enough, and her lips could not
satisfy all that she had to say in prayer. True, she never gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
up her flirtations. They seemed to be an indispensable outlet to
her nature. But experience had taught her the boundary lines
which lie between men and women. This, and a refreshed enthusiasm
for the church guided her life successfully for the
ensuing six or seven years.</p>

<p>She was twenty-four when she met Roger Lockwood. It was
at a fancy dress ball in Hartford, to which she had come a trifle
reluctantly, since the prospect of a repetition of familiarly identical
scenes did not stimulate her imagination. However, once
having arrived, she found herself enjoying the gayly colored
dresses and the jazz music. She quite lost herself in the crowd
of faces before her. As in her coming-out year, she allowed her
consciousness of self to be swept away, and, urged on by the
music, confronted one partner after another with a rapid-fire of
conversation and glances from her eyes. She seemed almost to
dominate the room at times—especially to-night—although she
could have given no very definite reason for it. Perhaps it was
merely that her ever active nature was seeking some new and
more thrilling experience.</p>

<p>Roger, on the other hand, was not participating to any great
extent in the dancing. He was something of a ludicrous figure—calm,
passive, tall, and dressed as a young Southern gentleman
of the thirties, in brown plaid trousers, high collar, and black
bow tie. He wandered listlessly from one corner of the room to
another, keeping his eyes upon the figures of the dancers, but
rarely cutting in. He seemed to be searching for something
intangible—so intangible that he did not know what it was. He
could merely contemplate the faces around him, and follow the
rhythm of the music in an imaginative way. Roger was a visitor
at Hartford. He was up there seeking merely for diversion. He
wanted to divert his mind from the constantly recurrant thoughts
of his fiancée, who had gone with her family to Europe for the
winter.</p>

<p>Stolidly he “looked over” the girls as they went past. He was
surprised to find so many of them really beautiful. There was
one in particular who was dressed in the costume of the harem,—scarlet
with spangles,—and whose fair, almost childish, face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
suggested moonlight and a kind of misplaced romance. Her light
hair hung prettily over her forehead. She talked with her partners
in an intimate way. He was introduced to her. But he
could proceed no more than a few steps before some one cut in;
and although he repeated this process several times, he found at
last more satisfaction in gazing at her from a distance and experiencing
a tantalizing feeling in the unattainableness of her
beauty. After all, it did not matter much since he was engaged
to a girl fully as beautiful. Besides, there were plenty of others
to dance with. And presently he became aware of a slim, dark-haired
figure, in a gipsy costume, which often swept by him. He
looked more closely at the face; and once he caught the mischievous,
half-serious glance of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” he asked his friend, standing beside him.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“That girl in a gipsy dress.”</p>

<p>“That’s Helen Trumbull. Want to meet her?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>His friend dragged him by the arm into the midst of the dancers.
Roger could not help thinking how ridiculous his brown plaid
trousers must appear.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lockwood—Mr. Trumbull.”</p>

<p>They danced. Roger experienced a slight thrill in the way she
held him. Her touch was very delicate. But she kept her hand
perhaps a trifle too far toward the back of her neck.</p>

<p>“Here I am at last,” he said. “I have been looking for you all
evening.”</p>

<p>“How tragic, to be kept in such agony of suspense for three
hours!”</p>

<p>She said it so quickly that he was put on his mettle. “Has it
only been three hours? It seemed like six!”</p>

<p>She laughed. “May I ask <i>why</i> you delayed so long?”</p>

<p>“I was stuck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, too bad. With whom?”</p>

<p>“With Dorothy Hollingshead.” He referred to the girl in the
scarlet harem costume.</p>

<p>“Oh, really! How exceptional! I suppose you are still stuck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“No,” he replied; “I’m free at last.”</p>

<p>They looked at each other and laughed. But Roger thought,
“Hell, this is platitudinous”; and felt that there was more to be
found in her personality than these rather strained mental gymnastics.
“Let’s sit out,” he suggested on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>“Already? Why I hardly <i>know</i> you!”</p>

<p>“You might get to know me better.”</p>

<p>“Would it be worth while?” she looked up at him, on the verge
of laughter. He nodded solemnly. And presently she stopped
dancing and led him by the arm out of the room.</p>

<p>“This,” she said, as she sat down in a large gilt-edged arm-chair,
“is the most <i>un</i>conventional thing I have ever done.”</p>

<p>“Really? You must be something of a model of excellence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think I could be? I should like to be.”</p>

<p>He wondered how seriously to take this remark.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said she, “you’re a skeptic. You don’t believe any woman
is a model of excellence.”</p>

<p>“I have never found one.”</p>

<p>She turned away prettily.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Roger, “it isn’t a question of models; it’s a question
of more or less.”</p>

<p>“And where would you put me—more or less?”</p>

<p>He hesitated, seeking for a clever twist to give the words.</p>

<p>“Oh there! You see! I have made a wrong impression.”</p>

<p>“I was going to say <i>more</i>. But sometimes my first impressions
are wrong.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you would <i>like</i> to have them wrong?”</p>

<p>How cleverly she had touched upon a forbidden subject!</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I would.”</p>

<p>They both laughed then, for it seemed that they had already
attained a kind of intimacy. He was aware that her charms
emanated not only from the way she spoke these, but also from
the whole expression of her face and her body, which was
tantalizing—a vague innuendo. He compared her, not unfavorably,
to Georgiana, his absent fiancée. But then he cursed himself
for a fool. Georgiana and he had grown up together.</p>

<p>They returned to the dance, chatting easily, arm in arm. But
when supper came, which was an informal affair, he found himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
leading her into a secluded corner of the room, where they
settled themselves into their chairs, and sipped coffee luxuriously.</p>

<p>“I think you’re a fast worker,” she said, right in the middle of
a silence.</p>

<p>He smiled. “I was about to say the same thing of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it wouldn’t be true—of a girl.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The finality of her voice would have been convincing, had it
not been for the expression of her mouth. But it was easy, from
this point, to branch off into a more serious discussion about the
relative functions of girls and boys. In order to ascertain her
reaction, he ventured the theory that a woman was always justified
in her flirtations; that the beauty of the moment, in love, was all
that really counted; and that an engagement was really not binding
if either party should lose interest. She disagreed with this, and
said:</p>

<p>“I think an engagement is sacred. Flirting—well, that’s the
food of life, you know. But it’s one of my principles never—”</p>

<p>She paused, fearing that she was becoming a trifle too frank
with this comparative stranger.</p>

<p>“Well, go on. Never—”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know you well enough to tell you.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Well, it’s quite obvious what you were going
to say.”</p>

<p>She bit her lip and colored, with a flush of anger.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think me a fool,” she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t. I admire you. I think an engagement <i>is</i> sacred—of
course. But what I meant was that often men are carried away—in
a moment—by a look or a gesture—by anything. And I
can’t exactly blame them for it. I can’t see how a man is expected
to live up to his ideal, in a case like that.”</p>

<p>“No.” She seemed to ponder the question carefully. “But
don’t you see, it’s the woman’s fault—when men are carried
away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>They looked at each other, then, each recognizing the potentialities
of their own situation. The look was intense. It sent a
flush across Helen’s cheek.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are engaged. How little I know about you!
Are you?”</p>

<p>He hesitated. “No,” he said at length. What did it matter?—this
one evening!</p>

<p>“Ah then,” she replied, “the sky’s the limit.”</p>

<p>“No; the stars!”</p>

<p>They both laughed and proceeded with their coffee. Somehow
the conversation turned upon religion. They grew more and more
serious. He respected her beliefs, although he did not hold them
himself.</p>

<p>“There was only once in my life,” she said, alluding vaguely to
the past, “when I didn’t believe. But I was growing up at the
time. I was fascinated by Byron’s character and used to picture
him as an ideal lover. Then I read some of Mathew Arnold.
Have you ever read him.”</p>

<p>“Yes—long ago—at college.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “Long ago?”</p>

<p>“Well, four or five years ago—I don’t remember exactly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>must</i> read him again. He will give you a new point
of view.”</p>

<p>“Did he give you that—that theory about engagements?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?”</p>

<p>“Oh—why—from myself, I guess. It’s common sense, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Isn’t that the way morals are made—from common
sense? Don’t your principles, as you call them, come mostly
from your own common sense, rather than from your religion?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. “Well, put it this way: I think out my principles,
and religion gives me the strength to live up to them. There
now—that’s almost like Mathew Arnold.”</p>

<p>There was quite a long silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“My, but we’ve gotten serious,” she said at last, and looked at
him, as though to see if he were playing with her. But it was
evident that he was not.</p>

<p>Presently they returned again to the dance.</p>

<p>Roger decided to prolong his visit to Hartford, and in the
course of the next few days he saw her several times. She did
not live very far out of town. For her part, Helen found herself
dangerously fascinated by him. Whenever she was with him,
she was led to suggest things “in fun”—things which would
actually be quite contrary to her puritanical principles. And he
always seemed to respond, up to the very limit, although he had
not so much as tried to take her hand. She reflected that she had
never flirted quite so violently with any man, without having him
spoil the excitement by an attempt to leave the realms of the
intellectual, and burst into the physical. Roger almost satisfied
her highest ideal.</p>

<p>She asked Mary Waterworth about him one night, and Mary
told her that he was engaged. Mary even showed her a picture
of Georgiana, which Helen gazed at for a long time. Georgiana
had light hair and large eyes, which were probably brown, and
almost classic features. She was very lovely, Helen thought.
The expression of her face seemed to say, “I understand Roger.
I belong to Roger. There is more to bind <i>us</i> together than a
night’s flirtation. There is the whole past.” Helen was jealous
in spite of herself. The picture, which was mounted in a large
silver frame, and which gazed out at the world innocently enough,
fascinated her. She could with difficulty remove her eyes from it.</p>

<p>“What are you looking at?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“Nothing—I—I thought the face seemed familiar.”</p>

<p>Why, <i>why</i> had Roger lied to her? What could be his motive
in telling her that he was not engaged? It seemed altogether
despicable of him—after her direct question.</p>

<p>The awful thought came to her that he had been playing with
her. She had always feared this—that some man would see
through her superficialities, and <i>play</i> with her. She drew a mental
picture of Roger’s calm, ironical smile, and his conceit in his
own success. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>That night they were to drive out to the country, to a barn
dance. Roger arrived in his roadster at the appointed hour.
Helen stepped into the car frigidly, not deigning to take his extended
hand. She was going to punish him—punish him—for
leading her on as he had. But no sooner had the car started than
he made her laugh at some foolish joke; and half of the frost
was thawed. Then, too, he was sitting very close to her. And
he had that damnably attractive look in his eyes. She decided to
defer the punishment—for a number of “reasons”. It would
spoil the whole evening—their last evening, since John was bound
for New York the next day. There would be so much fun for
both of them—to go ahead—to-night—just as they had been
going. Finally—and this decided her—by holding her knowledge
of his engagement secretly in the back of her mind, she would
be able to inflict a subtler and much more severe punishment upon
him when he was not expecting it. She would be in the position
of an opportunist, with hidden weapons ready for the emergencies.
So she sat back comfortably in the seat beside him, and
talked in the most fascinatingly intimate way that she knew.</p>

<p>They stopped at the top of a long hill, and he swung the car to
the side of the road, so that they could see far out across the
moonlit Connecticut valley.</p>

<p>“We’re out of gas,” he said with a smile, “and besides, I want
to look at the view.”</p>

<p>Helen rather liked the way he said it, since the engine was still
turning over healthily. Still, she hesitated. As he reached for
the switches and turned out the lights, she knew, deep in her
nature, that she could not control <i>this</i> situation. They had better
drive on. But then, there was the thrill of excitement, of the
new experience. Again she found “reasons”. Why, it would
be all right. John was in love with Georgiana. There was no
danger. He was a sane, honest man. He desired, like herself,
merely the thrill of the moment. Men who are engaged are safe.
Yet even as this thought flashed into her mind, she felt his hand
upon hers, and his arm around her shoulders. For a moment the
picture of Georgiana flashed before her eyes. She saw, again,
Georgiana’s beautiful hair and her supreme expression. Then it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
was that she gave herself up to Roger entirely, for the vision of
the other girl made him seem even more intensely romantic.</p>

<p>Her principles! Where were they now? After Roger had
started up the car again, the whole past seemed to cry out to her
that she had been unworthy of herself.</p>

<p>“Roger,” she said, holding his arm, “we ought not to have done
that?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because—you—I know you are engaged.”</p>

<p>He turned upon her, a little fiercely. “<i>How</i> did you know
that?”</p>

<p>“Some one told me.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if I am?” he said. “I suppose you think me insincere—and
a beast.”</p>

<p>“No, I was thinking of myself. I knew you were engaged. I
ought not to have allowed you to go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Hell,” he said, “it isn’t your fault. It’s Georgie’s fault. I
didn’t want her to go abroad. I told her that I couldn’t stand it.
But she laughed, not being able to understand a man’s point of
view. She laughed and said that if I really loved her, it would be
easy. But it isn’t easy, and I do love her.”</p>

<p>“Have you loved her—long?”</p>

<p>“All my life. We were brought up together. I can’t remember
any girls at all, without having the impression of Georgie mixed
up with them somehow.”</p>

<p>“And you have done—this—before?”</p>

<p>“Occasionally. You see, Georgie is a peculiar character. She
is too exacting. She sails serenely on—like an angel—imagining
that everyone else is an angel also. Sometimes, when she deserts
me for a long time, I don’t live up to scratch. I always complain
to her, and tell her about it. But she laughs, and calls me silly.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been engaged?”</p>

<p>“Actually, only about six months.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” The problem fascinated Helen. And it was, for her,
an important problem, since she wished to ascertain how much
evil she had done. She began to feel extremely unhappy, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
only because she had broken her principles, but mainly because
she had lost her supremacy as mistress of the situation. Artistically,
she had failed. And she writhed at the thought of how the
punishment which she had intended to inflict upon Roger had
turned itself back upon her.</p>

<p>On the other hand, she told herself inwardly that neither was
Roger really in love with Georgiana, nor Georgiana with Roger.
She reiterated this several times. It gave her comfort. And she
justified her presumption on the grounds that Roger was too easily
led astray, and Georgiana apparently too casual, for any very
lasting relationship to exist between them.</p>

<p>Toward the close of that evening she began to feel more the
mistress of the situation again.</p>

<p>Of course, after Roger had gone back to New York, she experienced
some qualms. Indeed, there were times when it made
her utterly miserable, to think what she had done, and when
Georgiana’s picture would come before her eyes again to arouse a
poignant feeling of remorse. Her flirtations had not only been
unfair to Roger: they would be considered despicable by Georgiana.
And somehow she loved and admired Georgiana. At such
times, religion seemed the only outlet to her emotions, and the
altar the only pedestal upon which she could place her heart. Thus
she was comforted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that winter proved to be a period of emotional ups
and downs. Roger visited Hartford more and more frequently.
Each time he came the same scenes were enacted, alone, somewhere,
in the little roadster, on the highway. It was simply
inevitable. To begin with, he had kissed her once; and ever
after that his kisses seemed not sinful, but natural. She found,
also, that he filled a definite place in her life. She needed him.
And this need was only the more strengthened by the gradual
association of him with her religious emotions. Starting from
the feelings of remorse, her prayers gradually changed from
fervent requests for strength to keep Roger away, to pleas, as fervent,
that he come back again soon. Georgiana was thrust into the
background. Although she did not admit it, Helen was in love.
In a sense it was only her just share of the spoils that she have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
these short hours with Roger, while Georgiana was gallivanting
about Europe.</p>

<p>But such a state of affairs couldn’t last long. Helen had completely
rationalized her principles, and Roger had completely ignored
his duties toward Georgiana. He woke up to this fact one
day. He was at first disturbed, but later cleared up the matter
a little, with a grin, by saying that for a lover there were really
no <i>duties</i>. The mere fact that it seemed to be a <i>duty</i> for him
to leave Helen alone, proved a great deal—proved, in fact, that
he was no longer in love with Georgiana. What a stupid ass he
had been, all this time. He was in love with the past, but not with
Georgiana. He had allowed a childish emotion to dominate his
maturity. Georgiana was a lovely dream; but she could never be
his wife. Ah! Who else—who else—but Helen? His mind
fluctuated. It hovered indecisively for several weeks. He saw
Helen again. They parted, almost tearfully. And then the only
course seemed to be to write Georgiana, and break the engagement.</p>

<p>Here was a small tragedy. But he accomplished the task. And
the tragic feelings aroused were transferred over to Helen’s personality,
making his love for her all the more compelling.</p>

<p>Then he told her, one night, what he had done.</p>

<p>For her, it was very much like a pitcher of cold water poured
on one who is half asleep. With a gasp she was roused from her
rationalized dreams. The most terrible aspect of it was that the
deed was already done. It was irretrievable. She had instigated
it. She had allowed the whole affair to drift to this conclusion.
She could articulate nothing, but held closely to Roger, sobbing—torn
by the conflicting passions within her. Never before had she
actually seen God face to face. But now He came to her, as a
terrible, revengeful angel, out from the past; while Roger, who
sat there, seemed to represent the other extreme of her being—her
mortal love. Call it casual love—you Christian hypocrites;
call it anything you will; it was nevertheless present, in the person
of this man, and its power over her was irresistible. It seemed
to her that her nature would break in two. Especially after she
had sent Roger away, with her promise to give him an answer
on the morrow—especially then, alone in her room, she experienced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
a terrible feeling of being cut in half. The God of her
ancestors was simply merciless. “Why—why? What have I
done?” she cried. The answer was that she had flirted; she had
forgotten her principles—one moment—one fleeting moment; she
had rationalized; she had debased her own self-respect. Yet she
was in love, now, and he was in love with her. There was only
one course to be taken.</p>

<p>Perhaps two lovers never embraced more passionately than
these two when Roger learned the next day what her decision
had been. He understood, almost as well as she, the tremendous
storm within her. He understood that he alone could create a
haven where the storm might not enter, and where this delicate,
fitful ship could lie happily at anchor.</p>

<p>They were married quite peacefully in an old New England
church, and she went with him to live in New York.</p>

<p>Winter passed. Spring came. Georgiana returned. It is only
after some such calm as this that one can look back and contemplate
the true causes of a storm. Helen found, after she had
lived intimately with Roger for a short time, that there were a
great many things yet to be learned about each other’s characters.
Not only this. There were a great many things to be forgiven
in each other’s characters—more things, perhaps, than the average
man and wife can forgive. In the first place, she was vivacious;
he was stolid. She had a quick mind, essentially French; his
mind was slow and Anglo-Saxon. She was loath to recognize
these things; she tried to rationalize them. But they were there
continually to remind her that she had a very difficult situation
to manage, if she were to maintain her supremacy. Of course
she loved Roger. But it was not the same as in the days when
she had flirted with him.</p>

<p>Georgiana had come back—that was the difficulty. One day
she heard Roger return from work, and since he did not go directly
to greet her as usual, she started toward the parlor to greet him.
Yet at the door she paused, for she saw him in front of the
window, bending over something. Helen slipped behind the curtain
and peered through the crack. He held a picture in his hand;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
and as he went over to the light to look at it more intensely, she
saw who it was.</p>

<p>“God, but she was a beautiful girl!” said her husband, as he
gazed for a long time into those deep eyes.</p>

<p>Presently he turned, went over to a drawer in the bottom of
the book-case, and started to put the picture away. Helen retired
quickly from the curtain. What troubled her most of all was
Roger’s queer psychology, which concealed these things. Then,
too, there was the distasteful, though emotional, necessity of
obtaining the picture, and destroying it, without discovery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Artistry_of_Art"><i>The Artistry of Art</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">When we speak of an artist we do not think of a day-laborer.
Somehow there is a connotation of long fingers and delicate
features, an implication as of flowers, a suggestion of the super-fine.
About him as a halo is the word beauty.</p>

<p>Whatever materials he lays hold of, he plucks out of it beauty:
out of the dung-hill the flower, out of the chill moon passion, out
of the night light, out of the noon-tide shade. If he is found lying
in the gutter, as Oscar Wilde has remarked, he will at least be
looking at the stars.</p>

<p>The artist is primarily a temperament. He is a point of view.
Life may be a dome of many-colored glass, and the white radiance
of eternity thrown through it to our minds in varying colors, but
the artist sees them all, and so sees white, or sees none of them
and sees black. He looks at life comprehensively, and seeks a
unity. Where another is content with detail, the artist demands
structure. The general are genial enough to take life as it comes,
and are not concerned that it is chaos. The artist either goes forth
to meet life, or evades it utterly in both cases for the purpose of
making it cosmos. While others are content with a moderate
dividend of experience, the artist must have all of experience, or
none of it. He must be either a Pan or a Narcissus, a universalist,
or an egoist.</p>

<p>The Philistine world talk of artists as something not undesirable
certainly as past events, but undesired as present calamities.
There is in the air a sense of anxiety concerning them. They
make the complacent so uncomfortable. So has the world damned
them as unique, apart from the majority, being fearful of their
destiny, and has evolved, because of this fear, the false dogma
of spontaneous creation in art. A Dante is born the author of
the Divine Comedy; a Shelley rises a child from the womb the
inevitable father of the Prometheus and the Cenci; a George
Meredith is given a somewhat humbler birth in a fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
tailor’s shop the fated creator of the “Egoist” and Modern Love.</p>

<p>At any play, novel or poem in which destiny played such an
omnipotent part the world would turn up its nose, and say: “Absurd!
That’s not real, that’s not life.” But in the case of the
world’s artists it pleases the general to say: “Well, well, life is
stranger than fiction, is it not?”</p>

<p>A modern philosopher has written, and it seems to me most
wisely, “Our temperaments are in some sort our destinies”. Now
let me admit thus far the world’s conclusion. The true artist is
born like the rest of us with a certain temperament, which is in
some sort his destiny. But it is at this point we must leave the
world. For if it were only this birthright that was required,
certainly there would be in this present day a plethora of geniuses.</p>

<p>The artist is primarily a temperament, but secondarily he is an
artist. The importance I attach to this secondary cause of creative
ability is the importance of the unknown, or at best the unrecognized.
For it is in the world’s tradition to ignore this fact. Only
the geniuses themselves have spoken for the artistry of art.</p>

<p>Let us consider this paradox for a moment. The world’s idea
of an artist as born the child of destiny, conceived in the womb
of Fate, fore-doomed a priori; and the world’s idea of all other
men as free, at least in part, to form and fashion their own daily
lives.</p>

<p>When we speak of an artist we do not think of a day-laborer,
nor of labor. We are amused at Whistler’s famous repartee to
Ruskin’s lawyer when he asked him how he dared charge so much
for an hour’s work, and Whistler replied, “Not for an hour’s
work, but for the knowledge of a lifetime,” but as a jury we are
not convinced by it. And yet in following the development of
certain great poets I am more and more capable of imagining
what I know to be true, that, granted the temperament, genius
is made by intense industry; and that it is labor which causes the
difference between the great man and the unhappy dilettante.</p>

<p>Dante’s “Vita Nuova” is merely a promise of the Divine
Comedy. His greatness consists not in his having made, but in
his having kept that promise. You have in this little book a
beautiful example of the artistic temperament, and a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
statement of the methods of greatness: “Then it came to pass
that, walking on a road alongside of which was flowing a very
clear stream, so great a desire to say somewhat in verse came
upon me, that I began to consider the method I should observe....
Then I say that my tongue spoke as if it moved of its own
accord, and said, ‘Ladies that have intelligence of Love.’ These
words I laid up in my mind with great joy, thinking to take them
for my beginning; wherefore then, having returned to the above-mentioned
city, after some days of thought I began a canzone
with this beginning.”</p>

<p>Now I do not think that walking along a road by a river and
thinking of a girl one loves, and speaking, as if one’s tongue
moved of its own accord, a line of verse concerning her is an
unusual performance. In fact, given the temperament, it seems
a very natural one. I venture to say that no one who has ever written
poetry has not done the same. And Dante’s resulting poem is not
extraordinary. It certainly could not at the time have suggested
by itself its author as a compeer of ὁ ποιήτη. It exemplifies the
artistic temperament, and is indicative of it. By it we know
Dante to be a poet. Of his greatness as yet we know nothing.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that at the close of this book of his youth this
young and intense Italian mentions a vision by which was disclosed
to him a secret: “After this sonnet, a wonderful vision
appeared to me, in which I saw things which made me resolve to
speak no more of this blessed one, until I could more worthily
treat of her. And to attain to this, I study to the utmost of my
power, as she truly knows. So that, if it shall please him through
whom all things live that my life be prolonged for some years, I
hope to say of her what was never said of any woman.”</p>

<p>Dante was born a poet, but only after seeing this vision of
Beatrice which revealed to him the necessity of artistry did he
enter upon his new life of greatness in the middle of the way of
which he wrote the Divine Comedy. His method was as simple
as truth. He studied to the utmost of his power, as she truly
knows. You will remember the creation of the Divine Comedy
made him lean for many years.</p>

<p>So Dante, so Shelley; Shelley who is the example par excellence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
of the genius born to make his life an infancy, and sing his fill,
pouring forth his soul in profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
For when we read critically Queen Mab, we are forced to admit
that it is at best a mediocre creation of little weight in the scales
of beauty or of truth. The development to the Prometheus is
swift, but it is achieved by the method of industry.</p>

<p>You will remember how Shelley read all day every day, how
he read on long walks in the country-places, how he read in
London streets walking down Piccadilly, crossing Pall Mall. You
will remember how Trelawny describes him in Italy standing all
day leaning against the mantelpiece of his living-room, not moving,
intensely reading, and not stopping to eat, not even when Trelawny
left a plate of food by him, and went out. You will remember
how he worked on the Revolt of Islam, leaving Mary,
and going off to a little island, and writing all day without food
or distraction, undisturbed by the attractions of nature, being
part of them, and as them lost in the existence of his art.</p>

<p>Queen Mab was the work of a young untutored artistic mind.
The Prometheus, the Cenci, the Defence of Poetry are the
creations of a genius. The change is unusual, but not miraculous.
His industry was more intense than most, for he accomplished in
less than ten years that for which most geniuses require a lifetime.
From the stage in 1811 when “Reason is all in all”, and
“poetical beauty ought to be subordinated to the inculcated moral”
to the stage in 1820 in the “Defence of Poetry” where “There is
no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best in
morals, government and political economy.... But we want the
creative faculty to imagine what we know,” and to the contemporaneous
Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, where Reason is no
longer all in all and “the awful shadow of some unseen power”
is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Like aught that for its grace may be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From the early stage to the late there is a long road of intense
labor over which Shelley in his mad and impetuous way ran like
Pheidippides at top-speed the race of death and immortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“No doubt Shelley’s bad health in the autumn of 1817,” writes
one of his biographers, “was partly caused by overwork, for in
that year he had written as much poetry as would take ten years
in the life of a less impetuous writer.”</p>

<p>All his life Shelley spent in piling up knowledge from forbidden
mines of lore. With more energy than any other poet Shelley
performed the Herculean labors of greatness, and so swiftly was
it done that the world has fallen into the error of considering him
as a bird who sang inevitable songs.</p>

<p>In these two cases I have shown what seems to me to be powerful
evidence of the fact that, although artists are born, geniuses
are made. I have shown the methods of greatness as applied to
the lives of two great men. Actually, perhaps, I have been talking
about the artistry of the artist.</p>

<p>Let us turn for a moment to evidence of this same method of
industry as applied to an individual work, more strictly, perhaps,
the artistry of art.</p>

<p>“Love in the Valley” is unquestionably one of the great lyrics of
English literature. As unquestionably, I think, in its first published
form, it was a very mediocre, if not an utterly bad poem.
Let me quote you the first verse as it stood in the early edition:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Under yonder beech-tree standing on the greensward,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crouch’d with her arms behind her little head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her knees folded up, and her tresses on her bosom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lies my young love sleeping in the shade.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had I the heart to slide one arm beneath her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Press her dreaming lips as her waist I folded slow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Waking on the instant she could not but embrace me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah! would she hold me and never let me go?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is indeed a supple young lady. Consider that she is standing,
and crouching with her knees folded up, while she lies asleep
in the shade. I fancy it is a troubled sleep. Consider, too, that
in this verse there is an unhappy repetition of the word folded,—the
last mention of that word being in the wrong tense. Consider
that this is the first version of the first verse of one of the few
great lyrics. It is a poor thing, at best. There are flashes of
talent, but so are there in a thousand lyrics of young poets, nothing
of whose work is counted immortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>The artist is primarily a temperament, but secondarily he is an
artist, and his artistry, and the artistry of his art are what determine
his greatness. Geniuses are born, and are made? But many
are born, while few are made.</p>

<p>I think it is our duty to encourage greatness, even, if we, ourselves,
have not the creative ability to imagine what we know.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Gossip"><i>Gossip</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whenever, on a trip abroad, I went into one of the famous
galleries to discover my reactions to the great works of
art therein exhibited, I was struck by the realization that this was
quite impossible. I found that I was confused by all that I heard
about these things beforehand. The critics I had been advised
to read, the inevitable guide-books, and my friends with their
free scraps of information seemed all in a conspiracy to bewilder
me; I was jealous of having my privilege of praising and condemning
taken away and of being permitted only to ratify.</p>

<p>It is useless to say that one may rid oneself of such encumbrances.
Coldness toward the official guides and an active disdain
for the guide-books will not solve the problem; for Mr. Baedecker
is, after all, one of the last to introduce us to the arts,—we do
not arrive at his authoritative though concise eulogies totally
uninformed by any means. While one may not have been made
ready by intensive courses, the report of fame is not published
merely for those who take them, and you cannot escape hearsay
and the wealth of criticism that passes on the tide of conversation.
Even curt phrases such as, “You must go and see this!” or “Oh,
you <i>would</i> love that!” are to me insidious, and the type of gossip
which they represent makes a premature effect inevitable. In fact,
an educated person wandering in a well-known exhibition needs
no guidance, other than names and authors, to recall everything
to him.</p>

<p>I suppose those schoolgirls one meets abroad, daughters of the
wealthy studying “art” in its habitat, are the worst off in this
respect. You see them marching in herds through the museums
led by their formidable teachers, stopping to gaze and murmur
and look at the people passing while they are furnished with the
necessary facts. By the time they are finished with text-books,
scrap-books, and, lastly, exhaustive studies of the originals, no
saint can hide a toe from them. They know everything, particularly
dates. Leonardo was great; the primitives “have such feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
and are so naïve”; the teacher’s favorites are their favorites.
I sometimes wonder why they don’t carry it all a step further. Why
not organize it? Why not “Three long cheers for Raphael now,
girls! One—two—three—?” The middle-aged English maidens
who form so large a part of the tourist mob in Italy are another
set of victims. Steeped in their tawdry little enthusiasms, they
always go at things hard and correctly. If they like a thing, their
appreciation is like squirting a hose on it. One sees them make
a mistake once in a while and admire an atrocity. Nothing could
be more serene than their correction of such mistakes. I saw it
happen once before a statue of Hercules. It appears that the god
was not doing what he should be; he was looking for a giant to
wrestle with instead of sweeping the stables or something of the
kind. They had attended to the wrong statue, obviously, but
their waste of five important minutes was their only chagrin and
the hose was simply switched, perhaps squirting with a little less
force now—as though punctured somewhere.</p>

<p>Granted, at any rate, that you do not come empty handed to the
feast, some are of the opinion that if you have studied an object,
it is only reasonable to suppose that you will be the more interested:
that research enhances its appeal. This appears to be
logical. A full appreciation is to be achieved only through an
understanding of methods—of the points of view required to get
at the stirring qualities a thing possesses.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one hears that painting and the rest of the
arts hold the mirror up to nature, and it seems strange that we
are not furnished handbooks to the current exhibitions of the
latter. “You ought to know something about them!” we are told
when we go to the galleries. Well, if this predigestion may be
furnished us by our betters for our sight-seeing, why may we not
have it ready at hand for our days in the country? Why not look
up the good and bad points of a sunny day before leaving the
house, for instance? Or know from a greater, deeper Ruskin in
exactly what the “strength” of winter, as an artist, lies and where
to look for his weaknesses? Why, in other words, cannot both
types of aesthetic appreciation be dealt with in the same free
manner?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>Thus the problem is made real by the seeming validity of both
points of view. And I do not see a solution.</p>

<p>I believe that the modern idea of education is an enemy of
individuality in the average person interested in works of art.
Not that any man is insincere, though it goes hard against the
grain for him to throw aside the sophistication he has been a long
time acquiring and be simple: to kick his education out of the
way as it were and make a path for himself. To be caught overtaxing
our slim knowledge of the world and thereby to appear
ridiculous is no doubt disagreeable enough; but far more do we
fight shy of exposing any virgin soil. It seems so silly not to
appear well informed, particularly when one has the proof at
hand. Besides, it is a temptation in a more complicated sense.
Why should not a man bend every effort to see in fine works the
things that many minds of a brilliancy sharper than his own have
seen? Perhaps it is best just to ratify, or to satisfy ourselves
that we are at one with the great concensus of judgments—that
all’s well with <i>our</i> souls, at any rate. But if we come to judge for
ourselves, we are as judges who before seeing the evidence have
listened to the unanimous verdicts of countless others ranked wiser
than themselves.</p>

<p>As I see it, to be in sympathy with truth in this form or in any
other is a paradox except by natural inclination. To struggle
against it until we <i>reconcile</i> ourselves to something that may, or,
in the last analysis, may not be so, does not seem entirely satisfactory.
And I believe that a person cultivated according to
modern standards is unable to arrive at a definite conclusion of
the kind in question by following his natural inclination. He may
survive the temptation, more subtle in action than in its abstract
nakedness, that I have outlined, but if he does so it is a resistance
fraught with effort and as such harmful. The very determination
of a person to do justice to his individuality spoils the adventure.
The joy of a clear reaction is lost: that is the truth of the matter....
If I see this statue by so and so all I have ever heard about it
and him flocks in upon me. At once I am all at sea. I am impressed
by its reputation; my knowledge of it is large and solid
before me. Either I notice things which otherwise would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
have been obvious, or, more probably, I fight my prejudice and
go too far in the opposite direction, wildly exclaiming that I <i>will</i>
be independent. I am trying to get my balance. I know that
this may be done, but if I succeed in it, it is tedious work and to
be accomplished only by making a series of involved compensations;
and above all, it is hard to keep from doubting the truth
of the result. Would I have been so impressed?—I say in my
search for a genuine emotion;—if only I were unhampered! The
delicate mechanism of my appreciation has been tampered with.</p>

<p>I find that if I go to look at some new work concerning which
the criticism of the many is not yet crystallized, it is with relish
and a fine sense of relief. I have the same feeling when, after
studying under tedious tuition some novel of a great author, I
pick up another book of his to read alone. Now then, I wonder,
what is he like after all? For I am my own final arbiter whatever
happens; and I enjoy to the full my privilege of judging what I
see. This new thing at least I face as a free individual, as one
would like to face men, shorn of their reputations. I can discover
a swift, imperious dislike of it or love it vigorously, and not share
any orthodox enthusiasms. Lavish spontaneity is briefly in the
throne.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>The Cathedral.</i> By <span class="smcap">Hugh Walpole</span>. (The Macmillan Company,
1922.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">There are two classes of men who attain a piercing perception
of the fundamental truths beneath the mantle of social
usage which is loosely termed culture, a mantle which only serves
to detract the senses from the real goal of human activities. One
of these types is the stoic mentalist, to whom everything is mind
and reason. The other is the emotional, uncontrolled realist, who
lives for pleasure and dreams of ideals. Both of these divergent
types are able to see clearly the foibles which permeate the life of
mankind; the first because he realizes human weaknesses and
thereby refrains from falling into indulging in them, while the
second delves into the experiences and pleasures of the senses and
comes to a realization of the futility of it all.</p>

<p>Mr. Walpole has taken this antithesis as the principal theme
in his latest work, and the result is Canon Ronder and Davary.
The power of these two characters, however, is suggested rather
than described, and Mr. Walpole’s genius of omission is as commendable
as his power of description. The perpetual controversy
of the Church—between that which was once new and that which
is ever rising to become the newer—is treated dramatically by
attaching the teachings of both to human characters and having
them live lives according to their interpretation of such teachings;
the relative superiority of the opposing doctrines is thus put to
the test. The splendor of the Church is seen by eyes from under
different points of view, and discord arises between the officers
of the Church. Worldly ambitions and thwarted passions are
well depicted by Mr. Walpole, while an intensely dramatic strain
is refreshed by the youthful love affair between the Bishop’s
daughter and her sweetheart. “The Cathedral” is a work of
fiction which deserves to be ranked among the best—because it is
so unlike fiction.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>The Hill of Dreams.</i> By <span class="smcap">Arthur Machen</span>. (Alfred Knopf
Company.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">This book is new only to the American public. Since its first
appearance in England a number of years ago, its popularity
and power has grown phenomenally; Knopf could scarcely have
left it out of his collection of best modern books. It is sure to
make a lasting impression here upon all those who are able to
love and appreciate the remarkable beauties of a real prose style.</p>

<p>But, withal, I believe the book to be weaker than Carl Van
Vechten would admit. I believe it to be weak in the same manner,
and for the same reasons, I am inclined to decry the theses of
many modern writers. In a way, “The Hill of Dream” is a study
in the Psychology of Insanity. In a way, books like “Ulysses”
and “Babbitt” are studies in Sociology and Psychology and whatnot.
And, frankly, I do not like my science with my literature.</p>

<p>All this sort of intellectualism strives honestly for the truth;
“The Hill of Dreams” attains a unique and unrivalled beauty, but
any plot which selects one human specimen, and insists upon our
microscopic interest in him, following the author’s experiments to
the bitterest of ends, asks of us a little too much. These things
are like too-lengthy poems, which cannot sustain our emotions
through all their tomes, howsoever clever and beautiful they may
be. Our complex minds require more complexity in our literature,
more variation, less study and more story, than they give us.
Personally, again, I prefer “Vanity Fair” to the most beautiful
“-ology” ever to be written.</p>

<p>But that is far afield from “The Hill of Dreams”, and I should
be truly sinful to lose a reader for it by rhapsodizing. It <i>is</i> beautiful
prose, it <i>is</i>—after its own fashion—an interesting story, and it
is certainly true to a peculiar little minority of human life. In
these days when dramatic value must be subjective to be great,
it is a great book.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>A Hind in Richmond Park.</i> By <span class="smcap">W. H. Hudson</span>. (E. P. Dutton.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Reading “A Hind in Richmond Park” is like going on a long
walk over rolling fields and hillsides in the face of a stiff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
breeze. There is a tang and freshness in the book which is exhilarating.
You feel as if you were with Mr. Hudson in his
wanderings. As you open the book he smiles at you and takes
your hand and you are his. He takes you walking in England
or riding across the Argentine pampas and talks to you about the
sights and sounds en route, rambling smoothly from one thought
to another.</p>

<p>He calls himself a field naturalist, but he is much more than
that word implies even in its best sense. He is a poet of nature;
a sort of modern Chaucer in his whole-hearted delight in and
appreciation of the minute details in nature. The reader will find
scattered through the pages many of his own inarticulate musings
set down with charming simplicity and depth of feelings. Mr.
Hudson talks to you about smells, winds and sounds and you find
that you are listening to an expression of many of your own
thoughts.</p>

<p>The material of the book is a strange admixture of anecdotes,
science, and common sense which every now and then reaches an
almost poetical plain of thought. It is neither a collection of
essays, nor a journal, nor a narrative; it is really a set of printed
conversations—a member of that delightful species that may be
picked up for a half-hour’s reading, and laid aside again without
the charm being broken. Nor is this because the subjects fail to
arouse interest. Anyone who has caught nature off her guard,
who has walked abroad after a thunder shower in dry weather,
or who has tramped past newly-ploughed fields, or lain among
the cowslips on a crystal-bright May morning with the fresh south
wind in his face, will find a source of quiet pleasure in “A Hind
of Richmond Park”. He will forget that there is ice and snow
outside and too much tobacco smoke within, and will shut his eyes
and dream of pleasant summer days of long ago.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>The Waste Land.</i> By <span class="smcap">T. S. Eliot</span>. (Boni &amp; Liveright, 1922.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Any poem hailed by most of the really important critics of
this country and of England as “the most significant of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
generation” would naturally compel our attention. “The Waste
Land” does not cease to do that even after constant re-reading.
Although we are eventually convinced of the opinion just quoted,
our peculiar conception of its significance may vary a great deal.
It would seem to me it lies in its relation to the future of poetry.
Mr. Eliot has led poetry to the cross-roads and offered her a choice.
She must either follow him along the path which he has demonstrated
with eloquent conviction is disfigured beyond hope by the
tracks of many centuries or else branch off to a new untravelled
road. The poem is enormous and epochal by virtue of its
aesthetic implications. It is pathetically foolish to find justification
for its vast incongruities and obscurities in its broad design
or in isolated passages of beauty. Those who are doing the latter
give it an interpretation which its author manifestly did not intend.
If his purpose had been to create simple lyricism there
would be little sense in drowning it in a maelstrom of references
to over thirty books, written in several languages, and ranging
from Sanskrit maxims to American “rags”.</p>

<p>There can be no denial, however, that there is a definite and
organized pattern in the crazy-quilt. Even such lines as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When lovely woman stoops to folly and</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Paces about her room again, alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She smooths her hair with automatic hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And puts a record on the gramophone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are an integral part of the general plan. Superficially, that plan
has to do with the sterility of emotion in modern life and the
futility of human aspirations in all ages. But his most subtle
proof of the latter is to be found in the very form of the poem
itself with its concrete negation of all the most cherished ideals
of aesthetics. Eliot has shown us in this, as in his other work,
that he is capable of writing perfect verse in any number of
conventional modes. In “The Waste Land” he gives us a sample
of each with the implication that there is not one of them but is
as worn-out and vulgarized as the London desert.</p>

<p>This is my reason for believing the most profound significance
of the poem consists in the threat it throws in the face of poetry.
Will she continue to adorn herself in motley made up of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
battered fabrics of past triumphs? Or, on the other hand, will
some one come offering her what she most needs to survive,
something beautiful in its very freshness? Perhaps we should be
thankful for “The Waste Land”, as we are always thankful for
a warning signal. But we have no need to desire another.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>The Forcing House.</i> By <span class="smcap">Israel Zangwill</span>. (The Macmillan
Company.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Reading Mr. Zangwill we are often reminded of a rhyme
which Olive Herford appended to a cartoon of that author
in his “Confessions of a Caricaturist”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“This picture, though it is not much</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like Zangwill, is not void of worth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It has one true Zangwillian touch—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">It looks like nothing else on earth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In “The Forcing House”, the ever-original “Izzi” has attempted
an even more impossible task than the one he set for himself in
“The Cockpit”, to which it is the sequel. He has attempted to
dramatize the main feature of the Russian Revolution and the
confusions of an attendant Bolshevism. The dramatist has proceeded
in the conventional style of an allegory, but an allegory
peculiar to Mr. Zangwill. Though the whole is vastly confused,
each impression is clear enough and we finally emerge from the
long, bewildering maze of plots and counterplots, anarchies and
despotisms to find to our astonishment a remarkably precise and
clear understanding of the political and social conditions of present
day Eastern Europe. The chronicler offers no illusions. The
whole is plainfully plain.</p>

<p>At the very beginning the author scents the weakness of the
radicals. The Jewish Banker and the fanatic Riffoni are talking:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Gripstein: ‘But why is printing so dear? See how these
trade unions cut one another’s throats! So the proletariat won’t
pay for your ideas.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Riffoni: ‘They can’t afford to.’</p>

<p>“Gripstein: ‘Not four soldi? But think what they spend on
cinemas and cigarettes!’”</p>
</div>

<p>But it is not until the third act that the Duke D’Azolls lays
bare the full misconception of the Doctrine Lenin: “Not a
paradise of blossoming brotherhood, not a natural growth under
God’s heaven, but a Socialism ripened prematurely under the heat
of compulsion and watered with blood; a Socialism under a sky
of glass, unstable, sterile.... And forced—good God!—from
what seed? Constricting figs in greenhouse pots will precipitate
them artificially, but there is high authority for doubting if they
can be gathered from thistles.”</p>

<p>Mr. Zangwill has taken upon himself a monumental task. That
he has had any success at all is remarkable.</p>

<p>“No, you fool!” this from Ahaseurus, who was still wearing goloshes.

took Richard Cory into a corner, and the two of them decided to go over

<p>Mr. Percy says in his remarkable Introduction: “The Yale
University Press, thinking perhaps, with me, that even the most
beautiful things perish if the opportunity for reading or seeing
or hearing them is not offered the vexed and hurrying children
of men, has undertaken here the pious task of making
O’Shaughnessy’s finest poems accessible to readers of English
poetry.... His best is unique, of a haunting beauty, a very
precious heritage.... He had, as Palgrave put it, ‘The
exquisite tenderness of touch, the melody and delicacy’ of his
favorite composer, Chopin.... If I were passing the Siren
Isles, one of the songs I know I should hear drifting across the
waves would be that which Sarrazine sang to her dead lover
in <i>Chaitivel</i>:</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
